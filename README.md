# CONVEX HULL EXPERIMENTS

## Overview

This project consists of full implementations of three major algorithms for finding the [convex hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull) of a set of points:

- Jarvix March
- Graham Scan
- Chan's Algorithm

Completed as part of a group project alongside three other peers, achieving a first-class (95%) grade.

The code also includes a simple experimental framework to compare the performance of the three algorithms, along with plenty of sample experiments.
